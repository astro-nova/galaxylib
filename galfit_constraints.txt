# Note on parameter column:
#   The parameter name options are x, y, mag, re (or rs -- it doesn't matter),
#   n, alpha, beta, gamma, pa, q, c, f1a (Fourier amplitude), f1p (Fourier
#   phase angle), f2a, f2p, r5 (coordinate rotation), etc., .  Or
#   alternatively, one can specify the parameter number instead (for the
#   classical parameters only) corresponding to the same numbers in the
#   galfit input file.
